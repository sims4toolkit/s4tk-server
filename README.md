# S4TK Server

This repository is a simple example of how you might create an express server to use S4TK in any language of your choice. This example server is intended to be run locally, and has two endpoints for converting SimData between XML and binary.

To test it out, open this project in any editor of your choice, and run `npm start` to start the server. You can then run `python3 tests/test.py` to run the Python test file. You may need to install the requests package with `pip3 install requests`. You may also test this project with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
